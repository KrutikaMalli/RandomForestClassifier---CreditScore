### In this dataset, I have performed Credit score classification using Machine learning using Python

Banks and Credit card companies calculate your credit score to determine your creditworthiness. It helps Banks and Credit card companies immediately to issue loans to customers with good creditworthiness.

There are 3 credit scores that banks and credit card companies use to label their customers:
* 1)Good
* 2)Standard
* 3)Poor
